Media Remote Protocol Server
===

A server implementation of Apple's Media Remote protocol used in the Apple TV Remote for tvOS 9 and later.

This package is the server side equivalent of [node-appletv](https://github.com/evandcoleman/node-appletv). Thank you
to [Evan Coleman](https://github.com/evandcoleman) for node-appletv, [Jean Regisser](https://github.com/jeanregisser)
for [documenting some of the protocol](https://github.com/jeanregisser/mediaremotetv-protocol) and everyone else who
contributed to those.
